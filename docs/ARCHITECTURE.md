# System Architecture

Runalyst V2 is built around a unidirectional data flow: fetching from Apple Health, mathematically normalizing the data, running it through CoreML classifiers, and feeding the structured output into Apple FoundationModels for natural language coaching.

## High-Level Data Flow

The following Mermaid diagram illustrates the lifecycle of a `RunRecord` from extraction to UI presentation.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A["Apple HealthKit"] -->|"HKWorkout Queries"| B("HealthKitManager")
    B -->|"Raw Metrics"| C{"Framboise Engine"}
    C -->|"Normalizes dead-stops"| D["Working Averages"]
    D --> E("ModelManager / CoreML")
    E -->|"Predicts Class"| F["RunRecord DTO"]
    F -->|"Persisted"| G[("SwiftData SQLite")]
    G -->|"On-Demand Task"| H("RunAnalyzerActor")
    H -->|"Constructs Directive"| I["CoachingEngine"]
    I -->|"System Prompt"| J(("Apple FoundationModels"))
    J -->|"Structured JSON"| K["DrillRecommendation & Insight"]
    K --> G
    G -->|"@Query"| L["SwiftUI Views"]
```

## Core Components

### 1. Data Ingestion (`HealthKitManager.swift`)
**Role**: Extracts raw `HKWorkout` and `HKQuantitySample` data.
**Future Code Context**: When adding new biometrics (e.g., Running Power), add the `HKQuantityTypeIdentifier` to the read request. Do not attempt to calculate working averages here; pass raw arrays of buckets to the `FramboiseEngine`.

### 2. Normalization (`FramboiseEngine.swift`)
**Role**: The deterministic mathematical core. It strips out sensor "dead time" (e.g., heart rate < 40 BPM, pace = 0) to compute *Effective Working Averages*.
**Future Code Context**: Any changes to how fitness metrics are calculated must be made here deterministically. Do NOT rely on the AI/LLM to do math.

### 3. Machine Learning (`ModelManager.swift`)
**Role**: Interfaces with the offline-trained `RunalystClassifier.mlmodel`.
**Future Code Context**: Because CoreML output is non-sendable across Swift 6 strict concurrency boundaries, the `RunalystClassifierOutput` uses `@unchecked Sendable`. If you update the model to output new targets, ensure the Swift interface handles the new labels gracefully.

### 4. Background Processing (`RunAnalyzerActor.swift`)
**Role**: A `@ModelActor` that safely executes the heavy lifting in the background without blocking the UI.
**Future Code Context**: Never pass a `PersistentModel` instance across thread boundaries. Always extract primitive values into a `Sendable` DTO struct, perform the AI generation, and then apply the results back onto the model inside the actor.

### 5. Generative AI (`CoachingEngine.swift`)
**Role**: Sends the computed metrics and historical baselines to the native iOS 26 FoundationModels.
**Future Code Context**: When adding new drill types, add them to the system prompt's allowed ENUM constraint and update the deterministic logic in `RunAnalyzerActor` to flag them. Maintain strict token efficiency by using concise property names.

### 6. Presentation (SwiftUI)
**Role**: Declarative UI binding directly to the local SwiftData cache via `@Query`.
**Future Code Context**: Do not trigger data processing tasks implicitly within `var body`. Use explicit user intents (Pull to Refresh, Button Taps) combined with `.task` or unstructured `Task {}` blocks.

## Concurrency & Actor Isolation

To ensure thread safety and respect Apple's on-device AI rate limits, Runalyst V2 strictly partitions work across actors:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A["HealthKit (Daemon)"] -->|"HKObserverQuery"| B["@MainActor (UI Thread)"]
    C["WCSession (Daemon)"] -->|"WatchConnectivityManager"| B
    
    subgraph UI & Ingestion
    B -->|"ContentView.syncData()"| D[("SwiftData (Main Context)")]
    end
    
    subgraph Background Analytics
    E["@ModelActor (RunAnalyzerActor)"] -->|"Private Background Context"| F[("SwiftData (Background Context)")]
    end
    
    subgraph AI Safety & Queueing
    G["actor ModelInferenceSerializer"] -->|"LanguageModelSession"| H(("Apple Neural Engine"))
    end
    
    B -.->|"Passes PersistentIdentifier (Sendable)"| E
    E -->|"Queues Request"| G
```

1. **`@MainActor`**: Handles SwiftUI views, the view-level SwiftData `ModelContext`, and the newest-first incremental ingestion loop (`ContentView.syncData()`).
2. **`@ModelActor`**: `RunAnalyzerActor` runs on a background executor with its own private `ModelContext`. It is responsible for calculating 30-day relative baselines without blocking the UI. You must never pass a `PersistentModel` to it; only pass `PersistentIdentifier` (which is `Sendable`).
3. **`actor ModelInferenceSerializer`**: Acts as a FIFO queue (using `CheckedContinuation`) to protect Apple's on-device `LanguageModelSession`. Apple's `SensitiveContentAnalysisML` safety filter enforces single-client limits; concurrent calls crash with `Client rate limit exceeded`. This actor serializes all requests.
4. **Background Signals**: `HKObserverQuery` and `WCSessionDelegate` receive events on background daemon threads and dispatch them back to the `@MainActor`.
