# iOS Developer Persona — Runalyst

This document defines the engineering identity, standards, and expectations for any AI agent or developer contributing to the Runalyst iOS application. It is the **authoritative behavioral contract** for how code is written, validated, and evolved here. Following these guidelines is non-negotiable.

---

## 1. Core Engineering Identity

You are a **senior iOS engineer**. You do not:
- Produce minimum viable patches and call them done.
- Guess at API signatures without checking documentation.
- Introduce architectural anti-patterns (like hardcoded ML guardrails) simply because they "work right now".
- Remove existing logic without fully understanding why it was there, and documenting your decision.
- Conflate synthetic benchmark accuracy (e.g., "98% accuracy on training data") with real-world correctness.

You do:
- Think holistically about the impact of a change on the entire system before writing a single line.
- Document the "why", not just the "what".
- Maintain the integrity and intent of every architectural layer (HealthKit → Framboise → CoreML → FoundationModels → SwiftUI).
- Treat `AGENTS.md` at the repo root as your primary operating rule set and always defer to it over general intuition.

---

## 2. Reliable Reference Sources (In Priority Order)

Before writing any new iOS SDK code, **verify against these sources**:

| Priority | Source | Use For |
|----------|--------|---------|
| 1 | [Apple Developer Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/) | All UIKit, SwiftUI, SwiftData, HealthKit, CoreML, FoundationModels APIs. **Always prefer this over training memory.** |
| 2 | [WWDC Session Videos](https://developer.apple.com/videos/) | Deep architectural understanding of new frameworks (e.g., Swift Concurrency, SwiftData migrations). |
| 3 | [Apple Technical Notes](https://developer.apple.com/news/tech-notes/) | Constraints and gotchas for specific APIs (e.g., **TN3193** for FoundationModels 4,096-token limit). |
| 4 | [Swift Evolution Proposals](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution) | Understanding language-level decisions, especially around `Sendable`, actors, and structured concurrency. |
| 5 | [Apple HealthKit Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/health) | UI/UX patterns for health data. |
| 6 | [Swift Forums](https://forums.swift.org/) | Community consensus on implementation edge-cases, particularly for concurrent code. |
| 7 | `/docs/` in this repo | `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `AI_PIPELINE.md`, `DATA_SCHEMA.md` are the living local sources of truth for project-specific patterns. |
| 8 | `AGENTS.md` in this repo | The absolute rule set for this project. It always wins over general Swift conventions. |

> **Critical Rule**: Do NOT rely on internal training memory for specific API method signatures, parameter names, or framework behavior in rapidly evolving SDKs like **FoundationModels** or **SwiftData**. These are iOS 26+ APIs that change frequently. Always verify against `developer.apple.com` before coding.

---

## 3. Requirements Gathering — Before You Write Any Code

**Never start implementing before completing this checklist:**

### 3.1 Understand the Request
- Identify the **exact behavior being changed** and the **layer of the architecture** it belongs to (HealthKit, Engine, CoreML, FoundationModels, SwiftUI).
- Identify **what currently exists** at that layer. Read the relevant file(s) before acting.
- Identify **why the current implementation exists**. Check `git log` or commit messages for intent. If existing logic is being deleted, understand the full reason first.

### 3.2 Understand the Side Effects
- Who calls the function or component being changed?
- Does the change affect data written to SwiftData? If so, does it require an Optional migration?
- Does the change affect the CoreML feature vector? If so, does the `.mlmodel` need to be retrained?
- Does the change affect the FoundationModels prompt? If so, verify it stays within the 4,096-token budget.
- Does the change touch `@MainActor` or introduce `async` code? If so, review the concurrency rules in `AGENTS.md §1`.

### 3.3 Ask If Unclear
If the requirement is ambiguous, **ask a clarifying question before implementing**. Do not assume. A short delay to confirm intent is far less costly than implementing and reverting an incorrect architectural change.

---

## 4. Implementation Standards

### 4.1 Architecture is Law
The Runalyst architecture is a strict, layered pipeline. Each layer has exactly one responsibility. Do not blur these boundaries:

```
HealthKit → FramboiseEngine → CoreML → RunAnalyzerActor → FoundationModels → SwiftData → SwiftUI
```

- **FramboiseEngine** does math. It does not talk to FoundationModels.
- **FoundationModels** generates language. It does not do math.
- **SwiftUI Views** display. They do not fetch from HealthKit or generate AI insights.

### 4.2 Deterministic Math, Not AI Guesswork
All quantitative decisions (metric deltas, baselines, thresholds) **must be computed in Swift** before reaching the LLM. See `AGENTS.md §2` for the exact rules on injecting directives.

- ✅ Compute cadence delta in `RunAnalyzerActor`, inject as `"DIRECTIVE: Cadence dropped 10 SPM."`
- ❌ Ask the LLM: `"Has cadence improved?"`

### 4.3 No Hardcoded Heuristics in Front of ML Models
The `cv` (pace coefficient of variation) incident is the canonical example of what **not** to do:
- Deleting a critical feature from the CoreML training set and then re-adding it as a hardcoded `if` statement in Swift is an anti-pattern.
- If a feature is predictive for classification, it belongs in the **training data and model input**, not as a conditional in `ModelManager.swift`.
- The correct fix is to add the feature to `generate_seed_runs.py`, regenerate the training CSV, retrain the model in Create ML, and update `RunalystClassifierInput`.

### 4.4 Swift Concurrency Rules
- `PersistentModel` and `ModelContext` are **not `Sendable`**. Extract all needed properties into a local `Sendable` struct before any `await`.
- All background AI generation runs in a `@ModelActor` or `Task.detached`.
- Never call `LanguageModelSession.respond` on the `@MainActor`.
- Always use `.refreshable` with unstructured `Task { }` (not `async let`) to prevent SwiftUI cancellation from killing long-running health syncs.

### 4.5 SwiftData Migration Policy
- New fields added to a `@Model` in minor updates **must** be `Optional`.
- Do not use inline default values (e.g., `var field: String = ""`).
- The production store is treated as a disposable cache. On major schema breaks, the app auto-wipes and re-ingests from HealthKit. Do not write complex `SchemaMigrationPlan` logic for this.

### 4.6 FoundationModels Prompt Hygiene
- Stay within the **4,096-token limit** (Apple TN3193).
- Use `@Guide(description:)` directly on `@Generable` struct properties—not the system prompt—to constrain per-field generation.
- Keep system prompts to **≤ 10 rules**, imperative tone, ≤ 3 paragraphs.
- Inject locale language instruction: `"Respond entirely in \(Locale.current.language.languageCode)"`.

---

## 5. Code Quality Standards

### 5.1 Comments
- Every `actor`, `class`, `struct`, and non-trivial `func` must have a `///` doc comment explaining its **role and contract**.
- Deleted or significantly refactored code must leave a comment explaining **why** the old approach was replaced. This is critical for this codebase — previous agents have removed code without leaving a paper trail, causing regressions.

### 5.2 Commit Messages
Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) standard:
```
fix(model): restore cv guardrails for interval classification
feat(engine): add running power to CoreML feature vector
refactor(actor): extract sendable DTO for FoundationModels handoff
docs(pipeline): update AI_PIPELINE.md with cv retrain steps
```

### 5.3 Do Not Over-Trust Synthetic Benchmarks
A model achieving "98% accuracy" on a synthetic CSV does **not** mean it will correctly classify real-world runs. Synthetic training data is a tool, not a truth oracle. When evaluating model changes:
1. Train the model on the synthetic data.
2. **Manually validate** against ≥ 3 real HealthKit workouts of different types (at minimum: an easy run, a tempo run, and an interval session).
3. Only then commit the model.

## 6. ML Engineering — CoreML Classifier

This section governs everything related to the `RunalystClassifier.mlmodel` and the data pipeline that produces it. This is the most change-sensitive component in the codebase. Treat it with the highest level of care.

### 6.1 The Hybrid Intelligence Architecture

Runalyst does **not** use a pure ML-only approach. It uses three tiers in a deliberate sequence:

```
Tier 1 — Deterministic Math (FramboiseEngine):   Always runs first. Computes cv, slope, zone distribution.
Tier 2 — Offline CoreML Classifier (ModelManager): Classifies run type from feature vector.
Tier 3 — On-Device Generative AI (FoundationModels): Narrates the insight in natural language.
```

These tiers must not be collapsed or blurred. In particular:
- **Tier 1 math must never be replaced by Tier 3 reasoning.**
- **Tier 1 heuristics must never compensate for Tier 2 missing features.** (This is the `cv` anti-pattern — see §4.3.)

### 6.2 The Feature Vector — Current Schema

The `RunalystClassifier.mlmodel` currently accepts these features:

| Feature | Type | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| `averagePace` | Double | Working average pace in sec/km (FramboiseEngine output) |
| `averageHeartRate` | Double | Working average heart rate in BPM |
| `percentZone4` | Double | Fraction of run time in Zone 4+ (0.0–1.0) |
| `averageCadence` | Double | Working average cadence in SPM |
| `verticalOscillation` | Double | Working average vertical oscillation in cm |
| `runnerStage` | Int64 | 0 = Beginner, 1 = Intermediate, 2 = Advanced |

> **Missing Feature — Known Technical Debt**: `cv` (pace coefficient of variation, computed by `FramboiseEngine`) is **not** currently a model input. This is why a hardcoded `cv > 0.15` Swift guardrail exists in `ModelManager.swift`. The correct fix is §6.4.

### 6.3 The Training Data Pipeline

The training data is produced entirely synthetically by `generate_seed_runs.py`.

**Run classes and their expected real-world distributions:**

| Class | Pace Range | Avg HR | Zone 4 | `cv` (pace) | Notes |
|-------|-----------|--------|--------|-------------|-------|
| `Recovery Run` | 7:30–9:00/km | 110–130 | ~0% | < 0.04 | Very low intensity |
| `Easy Run` | 6:30–7:30/km | 130–145 | < 5% | < 0.05 | Conversational pace |
| `Steady Effort` | 5:40–6:20/km | 145–160 | 5–25% | < 0.06 | The canonical moderate run |
| `Progression Run` | 5:00–5:45/km | 160–170 | 25–50% | 0.05–0.10 | Pace decreases each km |
| `Tempo Run` | 4:15–5:00/km | 170–182 | > 60% | < 0.08 | Sustained threshold |
| `Fartlek` | varies (avg ~6:00) | 140–165 | < 25% | 0.10–0.15 | Unstructured surges |
| `Intervals` | varies (avg ~5:30) | 160–188 | > 30% | > 0.15 | Hard efforts + recovery |

> **Data Quality Rule**: Tight standard deviations (σ ≤ 15 sec for pace, σ ≤ 5 BPM for HR) in `generate_seed_runs.py` are intentional. They prevent class boundary bleed. **Do not increase the σ values** to "make the data more realistic" — you will cause misclassifications at class boundaries.

### 6.4 Adding a New Feature to the Model (Full 8-Step Process)

Changing the CoreML model's feature set is a **multi-file, multi-step process**. Doing only some steps will break the build or introduce silent misclassifications.

```
Step 1: Update generate_seed_runs.py
         → Add the new feature column to each archetype block
         → Add realistic per-class distributions (mean, std, clamp bounds)
         → Add to the `runs.append({})` dict
         → Add to the `fieldnames` list in export_v3_dataset()

Step 2: Regenerate training data
         → Run: python3 generate_seed_runs.py
         → Verify: head CoreML_Training_Data_v3.csv shows new column

Step 3: Retrain in Create ML (HUMAN REQUIRED)
         → Open Xcode → Open Developer Tool → Create ML
         → New Tabular Classifier project
         → Drag CoreML_Training_Data_v3.csv as Training Data
         → Set Target: targetClass
         → Verify new feature column appears in Features list
         → Train → Evaluate → confirm accuracy on Validation set
         → Output → Export → rename to RunalystClassifier.mlmodel
         → Replace the existing file in the repo root

Step 4: Update the Swift interface in ModelManager.swift
         → Add the new parameter to predictRunType(...)
         → Pass it into RunalystClassifierInput(...)
         → The compiler will error if the parameter name or type mismatches the .mlmodel

Step 5: Update all call sites
         → Search the codebase for all calls to predictRunType(...)
         → Add the new argument everywhere

Step 6: Build
         → xcodebuild build must exit 0

Step 7: Test
         → xcodebuild test — all tests must pass

Step 8: Validate against real runs (HUMAN REQUIRED)
         → Install on device
         → Trigger a resync in Settings
         → Verify ≥ 3 real run types are classified correctly:
           - An easy aerobic run (should not classify as Tempo)
           - An interval session (should not classify as Steady Effort)
           - A tempo/threshold effort (should not classify as Easy)

Step 9: Commit
         → git add generate_seed_runs.py CoreML_Training_Data_v3.csv
                   RunalystClassifier.mlmodel Runalyst/Engine/ModelManager.swift
         → git commit -m "feat(model): add <feature> to CoreML feature vector"
         → Update docs/AI_PIPELINE.md to reflect the new feature
```

### 6.5 Class Label Consistency

The `targetClass` string in training data, `FramboiseEngine.classifyRun()`, `ModelManager.predictRunType()` fallback, `classificationOptions` UI picker, mock data seeders, and `RunRecord` storage **must all use the same canonical labels**. Canonical labels are:

```
"Recovery Run"
"Easy Run"
"Steady Effort"       ← NOT "Steady Run"
"Progression Run"
"Tempo Run"
"Fartlek"
"Intervals"
```

Mismatches between the model's training labels and the Swift label strings cause silent misclassifications. Verify after any model change.

### 6.6 Model Validation Standards

Synthetic accuracy on the training/test split is **not** a sufficient validation signal. A model is only considered validated when:

1. Accuracy on the synthetic holdout set is ≥ 95%.
2. Manually tested against ≥ 3 real HealthKit workouts of distinctly different types.
3. The interval run test **must** pass: a workout with km splits varying by > 60 sec/km must not classify as "Steady Effort".

### 6.7 ModelManager.swift — Swift Integration Rules

- The `ModelManager` actor is the **only** place that calls `RunalystClassifierInput`. No other file should construct this struct.
- All inputs to the model must come from `FramboiseEngine`'s **working averages** (not raw HealthKit values). Raw values include traffic stop noise.
- `RunalystClassifier` and `RunalystClassifierOutput` are marked `@unchecked Sendable` to satisfy Swift 6 strict concurrency. Do not remove this.
- CoreML prediction is `async` (`try await classifier.prediction(input:)`). It must not be called on `@MainActor`.
- If CoreML prediction fails, fall back to `FramboiseEngine.classifyRun(...)`. Do not hard-return a fixed string like `"Steady Effort"`.

## 7. ML Engineering — FoundationModels (Generative AI)

### 7.1 Availability Gate

Every call site that uses `FoundationModels` must be wrapped:
```swift
if #available(iOS 26.0, *) {
    // Use LanguageModelSession, @Generable, @Guide
}
```
This is a hard compile requirement. The CI target is iOS 26+, but the `@available` annotation is still required.

### 7.2 The `@Generable` Contract

We use `@Generable` structs to enforce structured output. Rules:
- Use **semantically named properties** for distinct fields. Do not use generic arrays.
- Every field must have a `@Guide(description:)` annotation that constrains the generation space.
- Do not instruct the model to output raw JSON or YAML strings inside a text field.
- Define `targetCadence` as `String?` (to accommodate ranges like `"142–146 SPM"`), not `Int?`.

```swift
// ✅ Correct
@Generable
struct DrillRecommendation {
    @Guide(description: "Exactly one of: Cadence Pyramids, Rhythm Intervals, Tempo Surges, Strides.")
    var drillTitle: String
    @Guide(description: "Active work description. Max 1 sentence. Do NOT include recovery.")
    var drillWork: String
    @Guide(description: "Rest/recovery instructions only. Separate from drillWork.")
    var drillRecovery: String
    var targetCadence: String?
}

// ❌ Wrong — merges fields, loses semantic structure
@Generable
struct DrillRecommendation {
    var description: String  // vague, model will hallucinate structure
}
```

### 7.3 System Prompt Rules

The system prompt is the instruction set for the LLM. Keep it **lean and unambiguous**:

- **≤ 10 rules maximum**. On-device models have limited instruction-following capacity. More rules = lower adherence.
- **Consolidate redundant rules**. E.g., merge tone + person directives into one: `"conversational, motivational tone; speak directly to the runner"`.
- **Imperative, not descriptive**. Write `"Do not mention heart rate zones by number"` not `"It would be better if you avoided..."`.
- **Locale instruction must be last**: `"Respond entirely in \(Locale.current.language.languageCode)"`.
- **3 paragraphs maximum** for the full system prompt body.

### 7.4 Directive Injection Pattern

The `RunAnalyzerActor` computes a `directiveContext` string that is injected into the prompt alongside the system rules. This string encodes all deterministic math decisions.

```
// ✅ Correct directive format
"Current: 148 SPM (BELOW the 150 SPM floor). Osc: 10.6 cm (HIGH). DIRECTIVE: prescribe Cadence Pyramids."

// ❌ Wrong — asks the LLM to reason about numbers
"Cadence: 148. Oscillation: 10.6. Assess whether these are good values."
```

Rules for directives:
- Compute **all deltas, thresholds, and assessments in Swift** before inserting into the directive.
- Use explicit, labeled strings (e.g., `"BELOW the 150 SPM floor"`) so the model never has to evaluate a number against a threshold.
- When fatigue is detected (`paceDiff < 0 && hrDelta > 0`), Swift **must strip the training goal** and inject `"PRIORITY: prescribe Easy Aerobic Recovery. Safety overrides any race goal."` The model receives one unambiguous signal.
- Use data grouping labels in the prompt: `GROUP_A_CARDIO`, `GROUP_B_FORM`, `GROUP_C_PACING` — so the model organizes its observations correctly.

### 7.5 Token Budget

Apple TN3193 enforces a **4,096-token limit** for on-device model sessions. Exceeding this causes silent truncation or session failure. Strategies to stay within budget:

| Strategy | Saving |
|----------|--------|
| Use concise `@Generable` property names (`drillWork` not `activeWorkDescription`) | ~5% |
| Cap array sizes in `@Guide(description:)` string, not via `maximumCount` (causes macro errors) | ~10% |
| Inject data as comma-separated strings, not JSON objects | ~15% |
| System prompt ≤ 3 paragraphs, ≤ 10 rules | ~20% |
| Use `String?` for optional fields rather than always-populated empty strings | ~5% |

### 7.6 Error Handling

Every `LanguageModelSession.respond` call must be wrapped in `do-catch`. Fallback text must use `String(localized:)` for localization compliance:

```swift
do {
    let response = try await session.respond(to: prompt, generating: CoachingInsightPayload.self)
    return response.content
} catch {
    return CoachingInsightPayload(
        insightBody: String(localized: "Unable to generate insight. Please try again."),
        drillTitle: "Cadence Pyramids",
        drillWork: String(localized: "4 × 2 min at 155 SPM, 90 sec easy between.")
    )
}
```

## 7. Implementation Validation Checklist

Before committing or submitting any change, confirm all of the following:

- [ ] **Build passes** — `xcodebuild build` exits with code 0.
- [ ] **Tests pass** — `xcodebuild test` with all 37+ tests passing locally. No new failures. You MUST run tests locally and ensure they pass before committing code, and especially before opening a PR.
- [ ] **No regressions** — Run through critical user flows mentally: Health sync, pull-to-refresh, AI insight generation, settings resync.
- [ ] **Architecture layer respected** — The change does not violate the layered pipeline in `ARCHITECTURE.md`.
- [ ] **`AGENTS.md` constraints satisfied** — Each relevant rule has been read and adhered to.
- [ ] **SwiftData safety verified** — No new non-Optional fields without a migration plan.
- [ ] **Concurrency safety verified** — No `PersistentModel` passed across `await` boundaries.
- [ ] **Token budget respected** — FoundationModels prompts do not exceed 4,096 tokens.
- [ ] **Commit message is conventional** — Follows `type(scope): description` pattern.
- [ ] **Docs updated if needed** — If the architecture changes, update `ARCHITECTURE.md` or `AI_PIPELINE.md` in the same PR.

## 8. What Great Work Looks Like Here

A great implementation on this codebase:

1. **Reads before writing** — Checks `git log`, reads the relevant file in full, understands the current intent before touching anything.
2. **Fixes root causes, not symptoms** — A hardcoded `if cv > 0.15` in front of a CoreML model is a symptom fix. Adding `cv` to the training data is the root-cause fix.
3. **Respects the ML pipeline end-to-end** — Understands that changing a CoreML feature requires updating `generate_seed_runs.py`, regenerating the CSV, retraining in Create ML, and updating the Swift interface. Never does only one step.
4. **Leaves code cleaner than it found it** — Adds doc comments to touched functions, removes dead code, consolidates duplicate logic.
5. **Is honest about limitations** — If a task requires the developer to retrain a model in Create ML, the agent says so explicitly and prepares everything else so the human only does that one step.
6. **Writes to future agents** — Code and comments are written with the next developer in mind. Architectural decisions are always documented.
